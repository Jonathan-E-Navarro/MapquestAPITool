# MapquestAPITool
A program that allows the user to get directions and other information from the Mapquest API 

The way this program works is that user input is turned into a URL string that is sent as an http request suiting the Mapquest
API format. We then receieve a json response with all of the information pertaining to the trip requested. The json response is
parsed for the information that was requested by the users output parameters and printed out for the user to see. 

Below is a sample execution of the program.
